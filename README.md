# Lovely Foods

A food discovery app for the residents of Lovely Professional University.

## About the app

The app was made in 2 parts... Backend (being hosted at heroku) and Frontend (being hosted at netlify). Backend provides an API which is then used by the app running on the front-end using ReactJS to dynamically render content and provide the data.
The best part of a free backend is... Anyone can make use of the API to make front-end apps (once we boost up the hosting)

## Installation

First to host the backend...
- Clone this repository
- Go to `lovely-foods-backend/` folder > `npm i`.
- Wait for the installation to finish
- To run the application in production mode `npm run start` or to test or run it in developement mode `npm run test`. 

> Note if the port is not set in the environmental variables the default port for backend will be 5000.

To host the front-end...
- Clone this repository
- Go to `lovely-foods-frontend/` folder > `npm i`.
- Wait for the installation to finish
- Run the application with `npm run start`. Wait for the webpack to build the bundle and then your site will be deployed automatically on port 3000.
